# Notes
- Find out fire size/area from given verticies
- Find out locations of water sources
- See if average point location works
- Play around with the goto function and see if what we see is what we expect
- See what happens when we set multiple waypoints
- Check if there are random physics issues that we are dealing with. Which way is the drone heading for example and are we turning sharply immediatley?
- Take a look at the telemetry dictionary 
- Take a look at whatever polygons are in telemetry
